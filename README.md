# query-multiple-databases
Super simple python script to query multiple databases at once


I'm a beginner using python, but the script should be pretty straight forward to use

It currently is only able to handle querying a single server.  Should be pretty easy to modify the script it to query multiple servers.  I might modify it myself if I need to later on.
